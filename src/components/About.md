Elevator Pitch: 

I started this project to both get more practice with web development and popular technologies while making a product that could contribute to the public good.

Technologies:
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind.css

What I Learned:
 This was my first full website I've built completely from scratch, from the design to the engineering. 
 Hard skills:
  - Using RESTFul APIs from 3rd parties to fetch data
  - Familiarity with Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind.css
  - used getServerSideProps to fetch data on the server side and take advantage of Next Server-Side Rendering

 Soft skills:
 - Had trouble breaking down the project initially, especially because I needed to both design and make the project. 
 - But, brainstorming away from the computer and breaking down my project vertically helped me stay focused and productive.
 - I also imitated weekly standups with a friend to practice accountability and AGILE workflow.
